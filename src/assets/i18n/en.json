Many people want to choose plant based for health and environmental reasons, but find it difficult to get high quality plant based ingredients that delivers on desired cooking performance. Imagine if there were great plant-based cooking alternatives without the performance trade off.\"</p><span>Top 4 advices when creating your insight:</span><ol class='list'><li class='list-element'>Use one insight for each concept. Hence, if you find that you actually have two insights in the description it is better to create an additional concept.</li><li class='list-element'>Do not write the insight direct to the reader – keep it general. Hence do not write \"You find it difficult\" rather write \"Some people find it difficult\". Remember that people do not like when you tell them what they think.</li><li class='list-element'>Everyone does not need to agree to the insight. If everyone would agree to your insight it is probably a too generic insight that does not give enough direction. Hence it should be possible for someone to say \"No I do not relate or agree to this\". \"I would like food that is tasty, convenient, good for planet and health at no cost\" is not an insight – who does not want that?</li><li class='list-element'>Keep it short and easy to read, using consumer language - with as few words as possible.</li></ol>",
